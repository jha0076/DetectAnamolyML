The problem of anomaly detection has been an active area of research in machine learning and data mining. Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data instances that deviate significantly from the norm. This is particularly important in applications such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, or monitoring the performance of systems and machines. In this project, I have been using a dataset that contains sensor data from a pumping system to detect anomalies.

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle, and can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data. It contains 53 features and thousands of instances. The first step in building an anomaly detection model is to preprocess the data. In this case, we drop any columns that have missing values and then scale the remaining data using MinMaxScaler. This scaling is important as it ensures that all features are on the same scale, and this can help the machine learning algorithm to learn the patterns in the data more effectively.

After preprocessing the data, we train a OneClassSVM classifier to identify anomalies in the sensor data. OneClassSVM is a type of support vector machine (SVM) that is used for unsupervised anomaly detection. It works by learning a decision boundary that separates the normal samples from the anomalous samples. The classifier is trained using the ‘nu’ and ‘gamma’ parameters, which are hyperparameters that control the degree of freedom and width of the decision boundary, respectively.

After training the classifier, we use it to predict the anomalies in the sensor data. The predictions are then added to the original data, and the results are saved to a new file. The resulting file contains the original data and the predictions made by the classifier, which can be used to further analyze the anomalies in the sensor data.

The results obtained from this project can be improved by using other machine learning algorithms or by combining the results from multiple algorithms. Another approach would be to use deep learning techniques, such as autoencoders or neural networks, to build an anomaly detection model. These techniques have been shown to be effective in detecting anomalies in complex, high-dimensional data.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how OneClassSVM can be used to detect anomalies in sensor data. The code provided can be used as a starting point for building an anomaly detection model for other datasets or for further improvements. Anomaly detection is a critical task in various domains, and this project provides a simple example of how it can be done using machine learning algorithms.
